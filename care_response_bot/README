Care Response Bot:
  What care response bot is a django coded positive reinforcement prototype
  that the user inputs a negative comment and then takes a prositive comment.
  This positive sentence is pulled from a text file and outputted to the
  website. This is just a very basic design that should later be remade for
  a simpathy api to find how negative or positive the users comments are.
